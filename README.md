# Recursive-Triangles
This program creates a recursive triangle drawing. It squeezes more and more triangles inside a base triangle that covers half of the frame and is upside down relative to the others.

It prompts the user for a value of n and creates a canvas that follows the same logic as this image. This project combined what I learned about recursion and graphics in Java.
